# Quizler-App
I developed a Python-based quizler application leveraging the tkinter library for the graphical interface and integrating APIs to dynamically fetch questions. Following object-oriented programming principles, I structured the application for modularity and maintainability, enabling seamless expansion and customization. This project showcased my proficiency in GUI development, API integration, and object-oriented design.
